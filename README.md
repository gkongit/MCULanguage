# MCULanguage
Translation files for MCU

Due to MCU being our(and probably MC in generals) largest event, we're looking to localize the entirety of it so that there are NO language barriers hindering any viewers or players within the event. To do that we need your help. We've created the base english translations of key events within the game but we need them translated to our core languages (ones included here) AND if possible any other languages. As we add more non-english speaking creators, our core language set may increase and those will be added to here for translation too.

# How to contribute

Click "Fork" in the top right of the page, then you'll be taken to your own version of this project (that you can fully edit, even directly via the web browser). Once you're there, click on the language you'd like to make translations for (for example lang_fr to translate our messages to French) and begin translating our prewritten English messages to your chosen language. We understand that not everything is translatable, so we're perfectly fine with it being as close as possible. 

# How to submit your updates

Once you've made your changes to the language file you've chosen, click on the "Pull Requests" header and in the top right corner highlighted in green you should be able to submit a new pull request. Give it an appropriate name (Proxying's French SG translations or something similar) and then click submit. Other users and our internal team will verify these to make sure nothing explicit has been written etc, and we'll merge your changes into our files. (Credit will also be given to you). These files will hopefully be in progress during our private Discord testing sessions as well, so if English is your second language you may have a bit of an easier time participating within those.
